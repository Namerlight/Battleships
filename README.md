# Battleships

For NSU CSE115 (C) Project. Built in C. MinGW compiler used.

Just a basic (I mean really really basic) and hackeneyed version of a game of Batleships. 2-Player, though only one can actually play at a time. One player sets up the ships (the biggest issue here, since I couldn't actually make it work anywhere close to how it would work and instead you just get to manually draw the whole board) and then the other player shoots. Score is kept, equal to number of turns taken, so lower is better.
